            <p>In 1947, East Bengal became the most populous province in the Dominion of Pakistan. It was renamed as
                East Pakistan with Dhaka becoming the country's legislative capital. The Bengali Language Movement in
                1952; the East Bengali legislative election, 1954; the 1958 Pakistani coup d'état; the Six point
                movement of 1966; and the 1970 Pakistani general election resulted in the rise of Bengali nationalism
                and pro-democracy movements in East Pakistan</p>
